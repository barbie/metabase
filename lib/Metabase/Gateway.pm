=head1 NAME

Metabase::Gateway - Manage Metabase fact submission

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $mg = Metabase::Gateway->new(
    fact_classes      => \@valid_fact_classes,
    librarian         => $librarian,
    secret_librarian  => $secret_librarian,
  );

  $mg->handle_submission({
    fact      => $fact_struct,
    submitter => $profile_struct
  });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Metabase::Gateway class manages submissions to the Metabase.  It
provides fact and submitter validation or authorization before storing
new facts in a Metabase.

=head1 USAGE

=head2 C<new>

  my $mg = Metabase::Gateway->new(
    fact_classes      => \@valid_fact_classes,
    librarian         => $librarian,
    secret_librarian  => $secret_librarian,
  );

Gateway constructor.  Takes three required attributes C<fact_classes>,
C<librarian> and C<secret_librarian>.  See below for details.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<approved_types>

Returns a list of approved fact types.  Automatically generated; cannot be
initialized.  Used for validating submitted facts.

=head2 C<autocreate_profile>

A boolean option.  If true, if a submission is from an unknown user profile,
the profile will be added to the Metabase.  If false, an exception will be thrown.
Default is false.

=head2 C<disable_security>

A boolean option.  If true, submitter profiles will not be authenticated.
(This is generally useful for testing, only.) Default is false.

=head2 C<fact_classes>

Array reference containing a list of valid L<Metabase::Fact> subclasses. Only facts
from these classes may be added to the Metabase. Required.

=head2 C<librarian>

A librarian object to manage fact data. Required.

=head2 C<secret_librarian>

A librarian object to manage user profile data.  This is generally kept in a separate
data store to isolate user profile facts from public, searchable facts. Required.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<enqueue>

  $mg->enqueue( $fact, $profile );

Add a fact from a user (identified by a profile) to the Metabase the gateway is
managing.  Used internally by handle_submission.

=head2 C<handle_submission>

  $mg->handle_submission({
    fact      => $fact_struct,
    submitter => $profile_struct
  });

Extract a fact and profile from a deserialized data structure and add it to the
Metabase. The fact and profile structs are generated from the C<as_struct> method.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature using the CPAN Request Tracker.
Bugs can be submitted through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=Metabase>

When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a patch to an
existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired feature.
